# WorkerMouse

An AVR project for a simple DIY mouse jiggler. This uses an ATTINY85, a 16MHz crystal, 4 capacitors, 3 resistors, 2 zener diodes, and a USB-C plug.

A parts list, detailed description, and images will be added shortly. For now, take a look at the KiCAD schematics in [./hardware](./hardware) and the AVR source code in [./firmware](./firmware).
