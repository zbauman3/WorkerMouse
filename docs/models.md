# 3D Models

I used PETG for the case, and separate colors for the lettering / case. This was the video I follow for using two colors with one toolhead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk1vKVphE1M.

If you'd rather not use two colors, you can simply omit the letter models and the letters will be debossed.
